## Looking into trends in refugee data, a case study of both the world and the United States.

Using Multiple Datasets from [UNHRC](http://popstats.unhcr.org/en/time_series) 

ALso from a kaggle competion using [WRAPS](https://www.kaggle.com/dhs/refugee-report) Data.

My goal is to see trends in the time series of each country of origin as well as study the time series results of country of asylum.

I'm using autocorrelation and LSTM's to predict the time series events for future refugee numbers.

Included and hopefully enriching is the CIA factbook from [here](https://github.com/factbook/factbook.sql)
