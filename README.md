## Looking into trends in refugees, worldwide and in the United States.

Using Multiple Datasets from [UNHRC](http://popstats.unhcr.org/en/time_series) 

ALso from a kaggle competion using [WRAPS](https://www.kaggle.com/dhs/refugee-report) Data.

My goal is to see trends in the time series of each country of origin as well as study the time series results of country of asylum.

I'm using autocorrelation and LSTM's to predict the time series events for future refugee numbers.

Included and hopefully enriching is the CIA factbook from [here](https://github.com/factbook/factbook.sql).



## The main Goal is to discover trends and offer insight into these popoulations

Questions and areas I'm exploring:

Top countries of origin for Refugees that come to the U.S.

The most type of displaced person population and hat are these population trends like in the U.S.

How has the number of refugees/displaced persons changed over the last 50 or more years?

Overall Trends worldwide?


## Other sources to build on

My goal is to add as many population features as I can for each country to paint a better picture of what's going on in the United states and elsewhere.
